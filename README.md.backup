"If seeds are sown while the preceding crop is still ripening in the field, those seeds will germinate ahead of the weeds."

"It's like the tree house, or a tree, represents branching possibilities," C said, the first night he was in Boulder. "When you are trying to plan with someone, it's like you are trying to swing up to where they are in the tree, trusting your weight to different possibilites."

They were walking by the pond, C and their father, by a willow tree. "It's just normal willow branches you can stick in the ground and they'll grow, right?" they asked. Yes, their father, R, affirmed. You would put them in water, let them root. 

"You could plant willow in a circle, along with grape vines, and weave them into walls as they grow." C was thinking about Ubuntu, ways of walling in the ground level.

"You really need to figure out how to get all those panes of glass lying around," R said, as C broke off the end of a willow branch, experimentally.

They were talking about the material for the multi-million dollar resource center that was going to be built, a project that stalled once large sums of money were already spent on quality lumber and double-paned (tempered?) glass, rotting in piles, breaking from having been leant against trees.

C didn't want to be an absentee landlord, or anyone's boss. 

They would be the owner on paper, but wanted to give away, as soon as possible, decision making power.

They would trade work for rent. What about equity? 

They should have a three year plan, at least.

# dreams

- Event space

	+ writing retreats

What would it look like if there were no rules? If C did or said nothing about how the space should be. 

Best case: Everyone felt like they could use the two levels whenever they wanted. Hanging out in the shade, working on projects, gathering for adventures and expeditions. The second level for writing, drawing, napping. Sometimes people stay there, sometimes multiple people at a time, without anyone filling out any forms or exchanging money.

The worst case would be that it goes unused, gets damaged, causes bad feelings between actors who feel that the others are shutting them out, or turning them away.

# goals

- to improve natural building skills and creativity
- explore and experiment with different kinds of construction
- Make use of found or recycled material
- Use as little fossil feul energy as possible, preferring simple methods and tools, even if it will take longer to produce cruder results.

In all conceptions of the game, though, you work with what you have. Any file can be an origin point for a mask, a quest.
